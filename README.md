# Percolator RESET

This contains the code for the associated manuscript, titled "[How to train a post-processor for tandem mass spectrometry proteomics database search while maintaining control of the false discovery rate](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.26.564068v1)". 

The important folder is *percolator_RESET* which contains the actual scripts that implements our procedure using Python, from the command line. This python implementation may be used as interim until the development in C (Percolator). For further details on implementation, see the wiki page.

A note to Lukas: for the development in C, please refer to the link [here](https://unisydneyedu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/jfre0619_uni_sydney_edu_au/Et239lX9DY9LjFA4GtfyHvQBMDRZbCc8dcU2QDaE_2mDPw?e=gUJDXR) which contains test files and their associated results using the current Python implementation.
